In "Directory" > "Self-Service Registration" > "Registration Form", you have an optional field to use as something like a concent checkbox, or privacy policy check box, the Self-service registration form for the org's default login screen will display a dropdown box.

This code is to hide the dropdown box in "Settings" > "Customisation" > "Custom Sign in" section.
